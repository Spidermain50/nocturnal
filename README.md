# Nocturnal

A colorful dark theme for VS Code. This is my first theme set, and any feedback is very much welcome!

There are two themes provided:

**Nocturnal**

**Nocturnal Minimal**

![nocturnal-minimal](./nocturnal-minimal.png)

This theme was inspired by the awesome [Alabaster](https://github.com/tonsky/vscode-theme-alabaster) theme. I wanted to be able to have a blacked out version for when the minimal syntax highlighting is suitable.

## Acknowledgments

* Colors were selected from the [Material Design](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors) color system.

* The minimal version of the theme was inspired by the awesome [Alabaster](https://github.com/tonsky/vscode-theme-alabaster) theme. I wanted to be able to have a blacked out version for when the minimal syntax highlighting is suitable.

* I love the [Hyper Term Theme](https://github.com/HasseNasse/hyper-term-theme) for VS code, but wanted to have a customized color palette and a minimal syntx highlighting version.
